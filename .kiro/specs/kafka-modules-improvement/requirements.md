# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive improvement of the Kafka Auto Configuration Library across all modules (kafka-core, j2ee-kafka-integration, spring-boot-starter-kafka-auto-config, and kafka-streams-auto-config). The improvements will enhance code quality, maintainability, testing coverage, documentation, and overall project structure while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Kafka Auto Configuration Library, I want clean, well-structured code with consistent patterns across all modules, so that I can easily understand, maintain, and extend the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any module's code THEN all classes SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and package structure
2. WHEN examining class implementations THEN all public methods SHALL have comprehensive JavaDoc documentation
3. WHEN analyzing code complexity THEN no method SHALL exceed 20 lines of code without proper justification
4. IF a class has multiple responsibilities THEN it SHALL be refactored into single-responsibility classes
5. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN all modules SHALL use consistent versions and avoid duplicate dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the library, I want comprehensive test coverage with clear, maintainable tests, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN each module SHALL achieve at least 85% code coverage
2. WHEN examining test classes THEN all test methods SHALL have descriptive names and clear assertions
3. WHEN reviewing test structure THEN tests SHALL follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern consistently
4. IF a class has complex logic THEN it SHALL have both unit tests and integration tests
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN all exception paths SHALL be covered with appropriate test cases

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the library, I want clear configuration validation and error handling, so that I can quickly identify and resolve configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing invalid configuration THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive exceptions with clear error messages
2. WHEN configuration is missing required properties THEN the system SHALL identify all missing properties in a single validation pass
3. WHEN validation fails THEN error messages SHALL include suggested valid values or ranges
4. IF configuration contains deprecated properties THEN the system SHALL log warnings with migration guidance
5. WHEN using the library THEN all configuration errors SHALL be caught at startup, not runtime

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want consistent code style and structure across all modules, so that the codebase is maintainable and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code formatting THEN all modules SHALL follow consistent indentation and spacing rules
2. WHEN examining imports THEN all classes SHALL have organized imports with no unused imports
3. WHEN reviewing method signatures THEN parameter validation SHALL be consistent across all public methods
4. IF a utility method is used in multiple places THEN it SHALL be extracted to a common utility class
5. WHEN examining exception handling THEN all modules SHALL use consistent exception handling patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the library, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand how to use each module effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading module documentation THEN each module SHALL have clear usage examples and configuration options
2. WHEN examining README files THEN they SHALL include complete setup instructions and common use cases
3. WHEN reviewing JavaDoc THEN all public APIs SHALL have parameter descriptions and usage examples
4. IF a configuration property exists THEN it SHALL be documented with default values and valid ranges
5. WHEN looking for examples THEN each module SHALL provide working sample applications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer extending the library, I want well-defined interfaces and extension points, so that I can add custom functionality without modifying core code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining core classes THEN they SHALL implement well-defined interfaces for extensibility
2. WHEN adding custom functionality THEN extension points SHALL be clearly documented and tested
3. WHEN reviewing factory classes THEN they SHALL support custom implementations through configuration
4. IF customization is needed THEN it SHALL be possible through configuration properties or custom beans
5. WHEN extending functionality THEN existing behavior SHALL remain unchanged (backward compatibility)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer deploying applications using this library, I want proper resource management and lifecycle handling, so that applications don't have memory leaks or resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application shuts down THEN all Kafka clients SHALL be properly closed and resources released
2. WHEN examining lifecycle management THEN connection pools SHALL have proper cleanup mechanisms
3. WHEN reviewing resource usage THEN no resources SHALL be left unclosed in error scenarios
4. IF exceptions occur during shutdown THEN they SHALL be logged but not prevent other resources from closing
5. WHEN using the library in containers THEN graceful shutdown SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
